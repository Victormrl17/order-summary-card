## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size.
- See hover states for interactive elements.

</div>

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- React

### What I learned

During this project, I reinforced my understanding of component-based design with React and CSS styling for a clean, professional layout. Here are some code snippets that were helpful:

```html
<h2>Order Summary</h2>
<p>
  You can now listen to millions of songs, audiobooks, and podcasts on any
  device anywhere you like!
</p>
```

```css
.card {
  width: 350px;
  background-color: hsl(225, 100%, 98%);
  border-radius: 10px;
  box-shadow: 0px 10px 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
}
```

### Continued development

I would like to keep focusing on:

- Better structuring of CSS for reusability.
- Improving accessibility features in my React components.
- Exploring more advanced layout techniques like CSS Grid.

### Useful resources

- **[MDN Web Docs - CSS Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexbox)**: A great resource for learning how to align elements in a responsive layout.

- **[React Documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)**: An invaluable guide for understanding the component-based structure of React.
